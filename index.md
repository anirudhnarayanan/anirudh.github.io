## Anirudh Narayanan

Iâ€™m a second year MS in Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am also a member of the Data Intelligence Research Lab (DIR-LAB) and am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dong Dai. My primary interest is in Systems Research currently focussing on Persistent Memory (near DRAM speeds of pointer level memory access with persistence), using the INTEL Optane 3DX point technology NVRAM (non-volatile RAM). My research is mostly aimed at creating efficient persistent and thread safe versions of common data structures. 

I am also a member of the CRESTLAB under [Dr. Thomas Moyer](https://thomasmoyer.org), where I am working actively on Distributed provenance ingestion and storage. A future scope of this project is to work on Analytics of this provenance data to be able to identify anomalies.

I am also interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and am currently working on an industry project with a startup company in Charlotte , [Vishion](https://vishion.co). The project is centered on color based design search and recommendation for users interested in interior decoration. This project is also under the guidance of professor [Stephen Welch](http://www.welchlabs.com/), who is the instructor of my Computer Vision course which is offering me this industry project.

I completed my B-Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita University Coimbatore, where I had the opportunity to be advised by [Dr. Shriram. KV](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/kv-shriram) on the project ECG-Biomatric: A Simple and Efficient Biometric using Weighted Thresholding and K-NN , where I applied basic machine learning to classify humans based on their ElectroCardioGram. Our final year project was given the honor of being in the top 5 best projects of that academic year.
